# Welcome to the Self Care Center!

Prepare to feel enlightened!

## About:

This project is an interactive website that allows the user to receive a random (yet perhaps universally designed?!) message at the touch of a button. Simply enter your name,  and find yourself in an endless amount of mantras and affirmations to carpe diem.

Within the center, you can also get your creative juices flowing by entering your own, personal, mantra/affirmation. This message will return to you, and also be added to the message database so you can continue to receive it over and over again.

## Walk through:

Below are a few snapshots of the self care center and the different feature the user can chose to use.
